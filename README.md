# mlb-sim

--Requires python--

## If on Windows, I suggest using wsl + ubuntu and running jupyter notebook

- WSL install: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install

- example install command: wsl --install -d Ubuntu

- install jupyter notebook: pip install notebook
- more jupyter install options: https://jupyter.org/install

## running the notebook
- open a terminal or cmd in the folder where this repo was cloned
- run jupyter command: jupyter notebook
- copy localhost link and open it in a browser
